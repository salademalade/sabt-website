<h1>About</h1>
<p>While Ole may be an ordinary boy, his dogs Sniff and Bark are anything but ordinary. When the sorcerer-ringmasters of the famous Cabbage and Turnip Circus Troupe attempt to capture the dogs, it falls upon Ole and his friends, the hot-tempered Anja, the serene Kathi, and JÃ¶rg to ensure the safety of the dogs.</p>
<p><i>Sniff and Bark Tales</i> first started as a comic strip made by a group of classmates and now updates on Saturdays. As <i>Sniff and Bark Tales</i> consists of mild amounts of violence, parental guidance is advised.</p>
